# Python Docker Application

This is a simple Python web application built using Flask and Docker. The project demonstrates how to containerize a Flask app using Docker to simplify deployment and ensure consistent environments across different systems.

## Features
- Multi-stage Docker build to optimize the image size.
- Flask web app running inside a Docker container.
- Supports running the app locally and in production environments via Docker.
- Exposes the Flask app on port 5000.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Python 3.x (for local development, if you're not using Docker)

## Installation

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/09atanu/my-web-app.git
cd my-web-app
```

### Build the Docker image:

To build the Docker image for the application, run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t portfolio:v1 .
```

This will build the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile`.

### Running the Flask app locally with Docker:

Once the image is built, you can run the Flask app using the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 portfolio:v1
```

This command will start the Flask app and map port `5000` of the container to port `5000` on your host machine.

You can access the app by opening a browser and navigating to:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

### Running the Flask app without Docker:

If you want to run the Flask app without Docker, you can do it by following these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the Flask app:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Files Structure

- `Dockerfile`: Contains the instructions for building the Docker image.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies for the application.
- `app.py`: The main Flask application file that serves the web app.
- `templates/`: Contains HTML templates for the app.
- `static/`: Contains static assets like CSS, JS, and image files.
- `Screenshoot/`: Folder containing any relevant screenshots or assets.
